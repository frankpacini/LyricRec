113,"Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst",Kendrick Lamar,"'When the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI woke up this morning and figured I\'d call you\nIn case I\'m not here tomorrow\nI\'m hopin\' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I\'m behind on what\'s really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI\'m fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that\'s blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan\'s rather vindictive\nEverybody\'s a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it\'s a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get \'em!""\nI got \'em and I ain\'t give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it\'s a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I\'ll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I\'m proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I\'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you \'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you\'ll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope— \nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled ""Brenda\'s Got a Baby""\nWhat\'s crazy was I was hearin\' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin\' her past and shit?\nWell, it\'s completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin\' for ass and shit\nAnd I\'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I\'m followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin\' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite \'cause he tip me with E\'s\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss \'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get \'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I\'ll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin\'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that\'s how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I\'m exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can\'t fit the pumps I walk in?\nI\'ll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I\'m not in the song\n\'Cause I don\'t need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor\'s approval is a waste of time, I know I\'m straight\nI\'ll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI\'ll never fade away, I\'ll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I\'m on the grind for this cake, I\'ma get it or die tryin\'\nI\'m eyein\' every male gender with intentions of buyin\'\nYou lyin\' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin\' about you can help \'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon\'t ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain\'t shit...\nWhen the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin\' away?\nIf it\'s today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost \'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin\'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin\' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I\'m doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I\'m not sure why I\'m infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe \'cause I\'m a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin\' when I\'ma rest\nAnd you\'re right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister\'s situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin\'\nThat\'s realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn\'t tryin\' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""\nCursin\' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what\'d happen if I ain\'t continue rappin\'\nOr steady bein\' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5\'s\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you\'ll be strong\nFightin\' for your rights, even when you\'re wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I\'m gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it\'s my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me forever\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me for— ooooh\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me forever\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me for— ooooh\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me forever\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me for— ooooh\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me forever\nPromise that you\'ll sing about me for— ooooh\n\n\n(On the phone)\n""Ay, ay, ay, where you \'bout to go?""\n""Nigga, the homie\'s brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""\n""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""\n""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""\n""Bring a nigga back a black!""\n""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie\'s brother, my nigga.

is bond\nI see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n\'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like\nYou know what I\'m saying, it\'s gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I\'m saying?\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that’s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin’, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true""\nRight\nYou know what I’m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it’s no problem, you know\nI mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know\nI’m finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down""\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n\'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don’t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don’t believe me, you can look around\nYou don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\nThat’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin\' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it\'s a riot it\'s gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don’t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it’s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain’t gonna be no playing\nIt’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?\nIt’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen\nThat’s crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\nBecause it\'s spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt’s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe’s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same""\nWhat’s your perspective on that?\nPac?
